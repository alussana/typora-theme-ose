# OSE Theme

## Main Features

`ose-2col.css` is meant to be used as a theme for Typora. It is inspired by the style adopted in the Old-School Essentials (OSE) rulebooks. Although not identical, it is meant to feature an easily recognisable look. This theme generates a 2-column layout on exported documents, optimising page  capacity similarly to the OSE books.

## Text

### Fonts

A compact but readable font, with tight line spacing, and bold headings. 

### Colours

Similar colours to the OSE books, with black text on white background, and a faint light green highlight for the H2 headings.

## Lists

Enumerated lists use bold numbers, like so:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Bullet lists use a triangular symbol, as seen in the OSE books:

* First point
* Second point
* Third point


## Tables

Compared to the OSE books, tables lack the title row and finer formatting options. However, they are kept consistent to the overall aesthetics by using a suitable colour scheme. 

| 00   | 01   | 02   | 03   | 04   |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   |
| 20   | 21   | 22   | 23   | 24   |
| 30   | 31   | 32   | 33   | 34   |

## Column Breaks

To insert a manual column break, add the following line of html code in the location where the column break should be placed:

```html
<div class="column-break"></div>
```

## Lines

Horizontal lines are kept thin and of the same black shade used for the text:

## Quotes

Quote blocks are highlighted in grey and feature a black accent line on the left border:

> Two households, both alike in dignity,
> In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
